    "In the logistics and transportation industry, forces acting on cargo shipments are critical to understanding how shipments will behave under various conditions. For example, wind forces, road resistance, and driver inputs create vectors that affect the shipment's motion. The resultant force is the vector sum of all individual forces acting on the cargo, and scaling the resultant force can help optimise operations for different cargo sizes and transport conditions.\n",
