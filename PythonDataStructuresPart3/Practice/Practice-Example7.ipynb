    "A retail store keeps track of customer purchases in a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a transaction, where the first element is the customer’s ID and the second element is the product they purchased. Understanding customer purchase behavior is key for optimising sales strategies and enhancing the customer experience. By analysing this data, the store can provide targeted promotions, manage inventory efficiently, and improve customer retention.\n",
