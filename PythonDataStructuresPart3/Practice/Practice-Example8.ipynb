    "A streaming platform wants to recommend movies by comparing a user’s typical genre-specific ratings with how other viewers have rated each genre of every movie\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each user has a genre rating profile — a list of numbers where each number represents how much the user typically rates movies from a specific genre. For example, if the genres are ['Action', 'Comedy', 'Suspense'], a user vector [3, 2, 5] means the user usually gives Action movies a 3, Comedy a 2, and Suspense a 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each movie is represented by a genre vector — a list of numbers indicating how highly other viewers rated each genre for that movie. For example, a movie vector [3, 1, 5] means this movie is considered strong in Action and Suspense, but weak in Comedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide which movie a user will most likely enjoy, the platform computes a recommendation score using the dot product of the user’s vector and each movie’s vector. The higher the score, the stronger the match.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function recommend_movie(user_vector, movie_vectors) that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Accepts a user vector and a list of movie vectors\n",
    "Computes the dot product for each movie\n",
    "Returns the 1-based index of the movie with the highest score\n",
    "If multiple movies tie for the highest score, return the one with the lowest index\n",
    "If any movie vector is not the same length as the user vector, return 'Invalid movie vector(s)'\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The output should use 1-based indexing. This means that the first movie in the list is referred to as Movie 1, the second as Movie 2, and so on — even though Python lists are 0-based internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the movie at index 1 in the list (i.e. the second movie) has the highest score, the output should be: 'Movie 2 is highly likely to be enjoyed by the user.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Input format\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "user_vector (list): Represents the user’s typical rating (float or int) for each genre. The i-th element corresponds to the user’s rating for the i-th genre.\n",
    "movie_vectors (list of lists): Each inner list represents one movie. The i-th value in a movie vector is the average rating (float or int) from other users that the movie received for the i-th genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output format\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A str 'Movie X is highly likely to be enjoyed by the user', where X is the 1-based index of the recommended movie\n",
    "Or a str 'Invalid movie vector(s)' if any movie vector is not the same length as the user vector\n",
