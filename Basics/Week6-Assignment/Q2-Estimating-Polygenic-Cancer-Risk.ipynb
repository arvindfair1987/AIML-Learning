        "### **Question Description**\n",
        "\n",
        "Hereditary cancer syndromes are caused by inherited mutations in specific genes that increase cancer risk. These conditions often result from the combined effect of multiple mutated genes rather than a single mutation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each gene has an independent mutation probability. If `k` or more out of `n` genes are mutated in an individual, the individual is considered at high risk of hereditary cancer syndromes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your task is to implement the function **`polygenic_disease_risk(n, k, mutation_probs)`** that estimates the probability that an individual is at high risk of hereditary cancer syndromes, based on gene-specific mutation probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note:** To calculate the probability that an individual is at high risk, consider all possible combinations of gene mutations (since each gene has an independent mutation probability). For each combination, calculate the probability by multiplying the individual probabilities. Then, sum the probabilities where `k` or more genes are mutated. This total gives the probability of high risk.\n",
