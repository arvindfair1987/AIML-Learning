Perfect — here are the **full, step-by-step solutions** to all **15 Advanced Finance Problems**.

# 📘 **SOLUTIONS TO ADVANCED FINANCE PROBLEMS**

---

# **SECTION A — ADVANCED MARKET RISK SOLUTIONS**

---

## **1. Historical Simulation VaR + Judgement Adjustment**

### **1. Compute the 99% VaR (Historical)**

250 trading days → 1% worst = **2.5th worst day**
We look for the **third worst** loss in the data.

Given: losses > $8m happened on **2 days**.

Thus, **99% VaR = –$8m**.

---

### **2. Judgemental Adjustment**

The risk manager believes geopolitical tensions increase downside risk.

They may adjust the VaR from **$8m → $9m or $10m** based on expert judgement.

---

### **3. Why historical data may underestimate current risk**

* Geopolitical shocks are **forward-looking**, not captured in historical data
* Market dynamics change
* Historical windows may exclude crisis periods
* Fat-tail risks and structural breaks may be missed

---

---

## **2. Monte Carlo Simulation: Volatility Regime Shift**

### **1. 15% volatility came from relative frequency**

Historical return data → standard deviation = 15%
This is empirical probability.

---

### **2. Judgemental update to 28%**

Implied volatility reflects market fear today.
The analyst overrides the historical value based on:

* current news
* expert opinion
* market expectations

---

### **3. Impact on simulations**

Using **28% instead of 15%**:

* Larger price swings
* Higher VaR
* Higher option prices
* Fatter tails
* Increased probability of large losses

---

---

## **3. Conditional VaR / Expected Shortfall**

### **1. Compute 95% ES**

Worst 5% of 250 days = **12.5 ≈ 12 days**

Given average of worst 12 losses = **–$9.5m**

$
ES_{95} = -9.5 \text{ million}
$

---

### **2. VaR vs ES**

* **VaR**: threshold loss
* **ES**: *average* of losses beyond VaR → captures **tail severity**
* ES > VaR → More conservative

---

### **3. Probability Approaches Used**

* Losses (data) → **Relative Frequency**
* Tail estimation often requires model judgement → **Judgemental**

---

---

# **SECTION B — ADVANCED CREDIT RISK SOLUTIONS**

---

## **4. Transition Matrix + Judgement Adjustment**

### **1. Original probability approach**

Transition matrices use **Relative Frequency** (historical observed transitions).

---

### **2. Adjustment approach**

Analyst’s belief = **Judgemental Probability**.

---

### **3. Revised PD**

Original PD = 0.5%
Belief: doubled → **1.0%**

---

### **4. Impact on bond pricing**

Higher PD →

* Higher yield spreads
* Lower bond price
* Higher expected loss
* Increased credit risk capital

---

---

## **5. Merton Model (Structural Credit Risk)**

### **1. Probability approach Merton uses**

Uses **Equal Likelihood** under **risk-neutral measure** + stochastic processes.

---

### **2. Why judgemental adjustments?**

Volatility can change rapidly; historical volatility may be outdated.
Analysts adjust based on:

* earnings instability
* market stress
* management issues

---

### **3. How empirical data calibrates the model**

* Asset returns estimated from equity returns
* Historical correlations
* Default boundary estimated from past credit events

---

---

## **6. Credit VaR Using Portfolio Models**

### **1. Expected loss**

PD = 0.03
LGD = 0.60
Exposure = 200 bonds (assume $1 each)

$
EL = 200 \times 0.03 \times 0.60 = 3.6
$

Expected loss = **3.6 units (or $3.6 per $200)**

---

### **2. Flaw in independence assumption**

Bond defaults are correlated due to:

* macroeconomic cycles
* sector-wide downturns
* contagion

Independence **underestimates tail risk**.

---

### **3. 3% PD comes from relative frequency**

Historical observed defaults of BB bonds.

---

### **4. Judgemental adjustment**

In recession, PD may double:

* New PD might be **6%** or more
* Credit VaR increases sharply

---

---

# **SECTION C — DERIVATIVES & STOCHASTIC MODELLING SOLUTIONS**

---

## **7. Risk-Neutral vs Real-World Probabilities**

### **1. Why different?**

Risk-neutral probabilities reflect:

* no-arbitrage pricing
* discounting using risk-free rate
* investor risk aversion embedded in market prices

Real-world probabilities reflect:

* empirical data
* observed frequencies

---

### **2. Which approach determines each?**

* **55% real-world** → Relative Frequency
* **48% risk-neutral** → Equal Likelihood + market pricing assumptions

---

### **3. Why pricing uses one and risk uses the other?**

* Pricing → must use **risk-neutral**
* Risk analysis → must use **real-world** outcomes

---

---

## **8. Binomial Option Pricing Under Volatility Jump**

### **1. Equal likelihood used early?**

Early textbook models assume:

* up/down states equally likely (simplification)

---

### **2. Relative frequency for u and d**

Usually computed from:
$
u = e^{\sigma \sqrt{t}},\quad d = \frac{1}{u}
$
where σ is **historical volatility**.

---

### **3. Judgement overrides history during volatility spikes**

Market shock → historical σ is outdated.
Analysts manually increase σ (judgement).

---

---

## **9. Black-Scholes Volatility Choice**

### **1. Historical volatility → Relative Frequency**

Based on standard deviation of past returns.

---

### **2. Implied volatility → Judgemental + Market Based**

Market prices embed future expectations → forward-looking.

---

### **3. Which to use?**

Use **implied volatility (35%)** because:

* reflects current expectations
* adjusts for crisis
* aligns with actual option prices

---

---

# **SECTION D — PORTFOLIO & FORECASTING SOLUTIONS**

---

## **10. Bayesian Updating**

### **1. Roles of probabilities**

* 12% → Relative Frequency
* 30% → Judgemental

---

### **2. Bayesian formula**

$
Posterior = \frac{Prior \times Likelihood}{Evidence}
$

---

### **3. How improves forecasting**

Combines:

* data
* expert judgement
* forward-looking signals

---

---

## **11. Scenario Analysis**

### **1. Initial probabilities based on?**

These are **judgemental**:

* Derived from economist or strategist models
* Not from data

---

### **2. Judgemental adjustment**

Recession more likely → increase recession probability.

---

### **3. Example new probabilities**

Originally:
40 / 40 / 20
New:
40 / 30 / 30

Total = 100%

---

---

## **12. Advanced Expected Return Forecasting**

### **1. Role of each approach**

* Historical returns → Relative Frequency
* CEO effect → Judgemental
* Equal macro state assumption → Equal Likelihood (simplified scenario)

---

### **2. Why historical-only is misleading**

Past may not reflect:

* new management
* new products
* economic cycles
* regime changes

---

### **3. Judgement in DCF**

Analysts adjust:

* growth rate
* margins
* cost of capital

using expertise = judgemental probability.

---

---

# **SECTION E — EXTREME EVENTS & SYSTEMIC RISK SOLUTIONS**

---

## **13. Pandemic Risk**

### **1. Why relative frequency fails**

Few pandemics → insufficient data → sample too small.

---

### **2. Judgement necessary**

Experts estimate based on:

* virology
* travel density
* policy risks

---

### **3. Hybrid framework**

* Stress tests
* Scenario analysis
* Monte Carlo with fat tails
* Expert-consulted assumptions

---

---

## **14. Fat-Tail Risk**

### **1. What is fat-tailed distribution?**

Higher probability of extreme outcomes than normal distribution.

---

### **2. Judgement overrides history**

If analyst believes historical data underestimates risk, they may:

* increase tail weight
* use t-distribution
* adjust kurtosis manually

---

### **3. Monte Carlo**

Simulates:

* fatter tails
* larger jumps
* higher probability of extreme shocks

---

---

## **15. Cyberattack Systemic Risk**

### **1. Equal likelihood?**

Wrong because outcomes are not symmetric.

---

### **2. Relative frequency?**

Useless: global cyberattacks are rare and evolving.

---

### **3. Judgemental probability only feasible**

Experts must estimate based on:

* technological vulnerability
* intelligence reports
* system interconnectedness

---
