# Partial Derivatives

By now, you have a good understanding of **multivariable functions**. We now extend the idea of derivatives to such functions.

For a **single-variable function**, the derivative represents the **rate of change of the function with respect to its variable**.

For a **multivariable function**, since the function depends on more than one variable, we measure the rate of change **with respect to one variable at a time**. These derivatives are called **partial derivatives**.

---

## Recall: Derivatives of Single-Variable Functions

If a quantity ( E ) depends only on temperature ( T ), then:

$$
E = f(T)
$$

The rate of change of electricity bill with respect to temperature is:

$$
\frac{dE}{dT}
$$

This represents the **instantaneous change in the electricity bill** for a small change in temperature.

---

## Motivation for Partial Derivatives

Now suppose the electricity bill depends on:

* Temperature ( T )
* Size of the house ( S )

Then the function becomes:

$$
E = f(T, S)
$$

Now we can ask **two different questions**:

1. How does the electricity bill change with temperature, **keeping house size fixed**?
2. How does the electricity bill change with house size, **keeping temperature fixed**?

Each of these questions leads to a **partial derivative**.

---

## Definition of Partial Derivatives

For a function of two variables:

$$
E = f(T, S)
$$

The partial derivatives are:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial S}
$$

Here, the symbol ( \partial ) (curly d) indicates a **partial derivative**, distinguishing it from the ordinary derivative ( d ).

---

## Interpretation of Partial Derivatives

* **Keeping house size fixed**, the partial derivative
  $$
  \frac{\partial E}{\partial T}
  $$
  represents how the electricity bill changes with temperature.

* **Keeping temperature fixed**, the partial derivative
  $$
  \frac{\partial E}{\partial S}
  $$
  represents how the electricity bill changes with the size of the house.

This allows us to **isolate the effect of each variable**, which is crucial in:

* Sensitivity analysis
* Optimisation
* Machine learning algorithms

---

## Why Partial Derivatives Are Needed

Even though a multivariable function depends on several variables, **each partial derivative measures the effect of only one variable**, while all other variables are treated as constants.

This idea is central to:

* Gradient computation
* Multidimensional optimisation
* Training machine learning models

---

## Calculating Partial Derivatives

Let us now compute partial derivatives using a concrete example.

---

### Example Function

Consider the function:

$$
f(x, y) = 2x^3 + 3y^2
$$

---

## Partial Derivative with Respect to ( x )

To compute:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
$$

* Treat ( y ) as a **constant**
* Differentiate only with respect to ( x )

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(2x^3 + 3y^2)
$$

$$
= \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(2x^3) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(3y^2)
$$

$$
= 2 \cdot 3x^2 + 0
$$

$$
= 6x^2
$$

So,

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 6x^2
$$

---

## Partial Derivative with Respect to ( y )

To compute:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
$$

* Treat ( x ) as a **constant**
* Differentiate only with respect to ( y )

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial y}(2x^3 + 3y^2)
$$

$$
= \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(2x^3) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(3y^2)
$$

$$
= 0 + 3 \cdot 2y
$$

$$
= 6y
$$

So,

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 6y
$$

---

## Summary for Two-Variable Functions

For a function:

$$
f(x, y)
$$

There are **two partial derivatives**:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
$$

* While computing
  $$
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
  $$
  we treat ( y ) as a constant.

* While computing
  $$
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
  $$
  we treat ( x ) as a constant.

---

## Example: Product Function

Consider:

$$
f(x, y) = xy
$$

Partial derivatives:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = y
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x
$$

---

## Interpretation at a Point

Consider the point:

$$
(x, y) = (a, b)
$$

Then:

$$
\left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right|_{(a,b)} = b
$$

$$
\left.\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right|_{(a,b)} = a
$$

* ( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} ) gives the **slope in the ( x )-direction**, keeping ( y ) fixed
* ( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} ) gives the **slope in the ( y )-direction**, keeping ( x ) fixed

---

## Extension to Higher Dimensions

The idea of partial derivatives extends naturally to functions of more than two variables.

For a function:

$$
f(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)
$$

The partial derivative with respect to ( x_i ) is:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}
$$

All other variables are treated as constants.

---

## Key Takeaways

* Partial derivatives measure **rate of change with respect to one variable**
* Other variables are held **constant**
* They are fundamental to:

  * Gradients
  * Optimisation
  * Machine learning training algorithms

# Partial Derivatives for Three-Dimensional Functions — Example

So far, you have learned how to compute partial derivatives for functions of **two variables**. The same idea naturally extends to functions of **three or more variables**.

---

## Example: Function of Three Variables

Consider the function:

$$
f(x, y, z) = xy + 4y^2 + z
$$

This function depends on **three independent variables**:

* ( x )
* ( y )
* ( z )

Therefore, it has **three partial derivatives**:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \quad
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \quad
\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}
$$

---

## Partial Derivative with Respect to ( x )

To compute:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}
$$

we treat **( y ) and ( z ) as constants**.

Start with the function:

$$
f(x, y, z) = xy + 4y^2 + z
$$

Differentiate term by term with respect to ( x ):

* ( xy ): here ( y ) is constant, so
  $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(xy) = y
  $$

* ( 4y^2 ): no ( x ) term, so
  $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(4y^2) = 0
  $$

* ( z ): constant with respect to ( x ), so
  $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(z) = 0
  $$

Putting it together:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = y
$$

---

## Partial Derivative with Respect to ( y )

Now compute:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}
$$

Here, **( x ) and ( z ) are treated as constants**.

Differentiate term by term:

* ( xy ): here ( x ) is constant, so
  $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(xy) = x
  $$

* ( 4y^2 ): using the power rule,
  $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(4y^2) = 8y
  $$

* ( z ): constant with respect to ( y ), so
  $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(z) = 0
  $$

Putting it together:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x + 8y
$$

---

## Partial Derivative with Respect to ( z )

Finally, compute:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial z}
$$

Here, **( x ) and ( y ) are treated as constants**.

* ( xy ): no ( z ) term,
  $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(xy) = 0
  $$

* ( 4y^2 ): no ( z ) term,
  $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(4y^2) = 0
  $$

* ( z ): derivative with respect to itself,
  $$
  \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(z) = 1
  $$

Therefore:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = 1
$$

---

## Summary of Partial Derivatives

For the function:

$$
f(x, y, z) = xy + 4y^2 + z
$$

the partial derivatives are:

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = y
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x + 8y
$$

$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = 1
$$

---

## Key Observations

* A function of **three variables** has **three partial derivatives**
* While differentiating with respect to one variable:

  * All other variables are treated as **constants**
* The procedure is identical to ordinary differentiation, just with careful attention to which variables are held fixed

---

## Big Picture

Partial derivatives allow us to:

* Understand how a function changes **along each coordinate direction**
* Extend calculus to **high-dimensional spaces**
* Build the foundation for advanced tools such as:

  * Gradients
  * Directional derivatives
  * Gradient descent
