# 📘 Applied Statistics 

## 1. What is Applied Statistics?

**Applied statistics** is the discipline concerned with the use of statistical methods to **collect, analyze, interpret, and present data** in order to answer practical questions and support informed decision-making.

It helps us:
- Understand how data behaves
- Summarize large datasets into meaningful measures
- Identify patterns, trends, and relationships
- Make decisions under uncertainty across real-world contexts such as business, government, healthcare, and science

---

## 2. Population and Sample

- **Population:** The complete set of individuals, objects, or observations of interest.
- **Sample:** A subset of the population selected for analysis.

### Example  
If the objective is to determine the **average height of all adults in a country** (population), measuring a **sample of 1,000 adults** allows us to estimate this quantity efficiently and economically.

---

## 3. Types of Statistics

Statistics can broadly be classified into **descriptive** and **inferential** statistics.

---

### 3.1 Descriptive Statistics

**Descriptive statistics** focus on **summarizing and organizing data** so that it can be easily understood.

Common descriptive measures include:
- Measures of central tendency: *mean, median, mode*
- Measures of variability: *range, variance, standard deviation*
- Graphical representations: *bar charts, histograms, box plots*

#### Examples
1. A cricketer (e.g., Virat Kohli) analyzes batting performance over the past year by computing the mean, median, and mode of all innings played.
2. A CEO reviews three years of sales data using line graphs and bar charts to observe trends and seasonal patterns.

---

### 3.2 Inferential Statistics

**Inferential statistics** use **sample data** to make conclusions or predictions about a **population**.

Key inferential techniques include:
- Hypothesis testing
- Confidence intervals
- Regression and prediction models

#### Examples
1. A government estimates the average income of citizens by surveying a random sample of individuals instead of the entire population.
2. A water supply department analyzes data from sampled households to predict water consumption for an entire city.

---

### Key Distinction

- **Descriptive statistics** describe what the data shows.
- **Inferential statistics** allow us to draw conclusions beyond the available data.

---

## 4. Concept Check

### True or False  
**Inferential statistics help us draw conclusions about a population using a sample.**

✅ **True** — Inferential methods generalize findings from samples to populations.

---

### Tabular Representation

In a dataset arranged in tabular form:
- **Rows represent observations (records)**
- **Columns represent variables (features)**

---

## 5. Types of Data

In real-world datasets, variables describe the characteristics of people, objects, or events.  
Each variable belongs to a specific **type of data**, which determines the appropriate statistical analysis.

Data can be broadly classified as:
- **Categorical (Qualitative)**
- **Numerical (Quantitative)**

---

## 6. Categorical Data

**Categorical data** represent labels or classifications and do not have inherent numerical meaning.

### 6.1 Ordered (Ordinal) Categorical Data
Categories follow a meaningful order.

**Examples:**
- Education level (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD)
- Movie ratings (1-star to 5-star)

---

### 6.2 Unordered (Nominal) Categorical Data
Categories have no natural ordering.

**Examples:**
- Gender
- Blood group (A, B, AB, O)
- Department in a company (HR, Sales, IT)
- Types of cuisine (Italian, Chinese, Mexican)

---

## 7. Numerical (Quantitative) Data

Numerical data represent measurable or countable quantities and are divided into **discrete** and **continuous** data.

---

### 7.1 Discrete Data

Discrete data take **countable and fixed values**.

**Examples:**
- Number of students in a class
- Number of cars in a parking lot
- Shoe sizes (6, 6.5, 7, …)
- Performance ratings (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Number of children in a family

> **Note:** Discrete values are not necessarily integers (e.g., shoe sizes).

---

### 7.2 Continuous Data

Continuous data can take **any value within a given range**, including decimals.

**Examples:**
- Height and weight
- Temperature
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Employee salary

> Although salary is recorded in fixed units, it is treated as continuous for analytical purposes.

---

## 8. Example Dataset

| Name | Department | Performance Rating | Salary |
|----- |----------- |------------------- |--------|
| John | Sales      | 4                  | 70000  |
| Jane | HR         | 5                  | 80000  |

### Classification
- **Department:** Categorical (unordered)
- **Performance Rating:** Discrete and ordinal
- **Salary:** Continuous

---

## 9. Important Clarifications

- **Age** is inherently a continuous variable, but it is often recorded as discrete (in whole years) in practice.
- **Numeric ratings** (e.g., 1–5) are discrete but often represent **ordered categories**, where order matters more than numeric distance.

---

## 10. Quiz

### Q1. Which of the following is *not* categorical data?
1. Gender  
2. Colour of paint  
3. Age of students  
4. None of the above  

✅ **Correct Answer:** 3  
Age is numerical data (usually treated as discrete when recorded in years).

---

### Q2. The number of water bottles purchased by a customer is:
1. Discrete Data  
2. Categorical Data  

✅ **Correct Answer:** 1 — It is countable.

---

### Q3. Which types of data can be stored in tabular form?
1. Categorical  
2. Discrete  
3. Continuous  
4. All of the above  

✅ **Correct Answer:** 4 — All types can be represented in tables.

---

## ✅ Summary

Understanding:
- **Descriptive vs inferential statistics**
- **Population vs sample**
- **Categorical, discrete, and continuous data**

is fundamental to selecting the appropriate statistical methods and making sound, data-driven decisions.
