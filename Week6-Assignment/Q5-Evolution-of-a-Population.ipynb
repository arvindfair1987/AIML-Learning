        "### **Question Description**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this problem, you are tasked with developing a **genetic algorithm-based system** that evolves a population of candidate codes towards a predefined **target code**. The system simulates the evolution of a population of codes, where each code is a string of **genes** which are encrypted to resemble lowercase English characters. The **fitness** of each code is calculated based on how many characters match the corresponding characters in the **target code**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The genetic algorithm will perform the following operations:\n",
        "- **Fitness calculation** to measure how well each code matches the target code\n",
        "  - **`calculate_fitness(code, target_code)`**: This function calculates the fitness of a candidate code by comparing it with the target code. The fitness score is the number of characters that match in both codes at the same positions. The fitness can therefore lie between 0 (no match) and 10 (full match). For example,\n",
        "    - **Code**: `'abcdefghij'`\n",
        "    - **Target Code**: `'abcdefgyij'`\n",
        "    - The fitness score is calculated by comparing each character; if there are 9 matches, therefore,\n",
        "      - **Fitness Score**: 9\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Crossover** to combine information from two codes (parents) and generate new codes (offspring)\n",
        "  - **`crossover(parent1, parent2)`**: This function performs crossover between two parent codes at a randomly selected point between **positions 1 and 9.** It combines the first part of **Parent 1** with the second part of **Parent 2**, and vice versa, to create two offspring. For example,\n",
        "      - **Parent 1**: `'abcdefgijk'`\n",
        "      - **Parent 2**: `'mnopqrsxyz'`\n",
        "      - Crossover point is **randomly selected**, say **5**:\n",
        "        - **Offspring 1**: `'abcdersxyz'`\n",
        "        - **Offspring 2**: `'mnopqfgijk'`\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mutation** to introduce random changes into the population\n",
        "  - **`mutate(code)`**: This function introduces a mutation to a given code with a **probability of 10%**. A mutation randomly alters one character in the code by selecting a new character from the alphabet. For example,\n",
        "    - **Code**: `'abcdefgijk'`\n",
        "    - If the mutation occurs, a random position, say **3**, is selected, and the character at that position is replaced with a new character, say `'z'`:\n",
        "      - **Mutated Code**: `'abzdefgijk'`\n",
        "\n",
        "These functions need to be used in the main function **`evolve_population_to_target(target_code)`**. This function runs the entire genetic algorithm. It generates the initial population, evaluates their fitness, applies mutation, and crossover operations, and evolves the population until it finds the target code or reaches a maximum number of generations (100).\n",
        "  - The function starts by generating a **random population** of 100 candidate codes using the provided `generate_random_code()` function.\n",
        "  - It calculates the fitness of each code and checks if any code matches the target code (fitness score of 10). If a match is found, the algorithm terminates early.\n",
        "  - The function tracks the mean and standard deviation of the fitness scores for each generation.\n",
        "  - It selects the **top 50%** of the population based on fitness, applies crossover and mutation to produce the next generation, and repeats the process **until the target code is found** or the **maximum number of generations (100) is reached.**\n",
        "    - Iterate through the population until you capture 50% of the population; this will help deal with tiebreaks\n",
        "\n",
        " Your task is to implement the genetic algorithm, track the evolution of the population, and report key statistics such as the number of generations taken and the fitness of the population at each generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Assumptions**\n",
        "- **Population Size**: The population consists of 100 candidate codes in each generation; each candidate code is a **fixed 10-character string**\n",
        "- **Target Code**: The target code is a **fixed 10-character string** consisting of lowercase English letters (`'a'` to `'z'`)\n",
        "- **Mutation Rate**: Each code has a **10% chance** of undergoing a mutation at any given generation\n",
        "- **Crossover**: Each generation, two parent codes are selected randomly from the **top 50%** of the population, and crossover occurs at a randomly chosen point between **positions 1 and 9** (both inclusive) in the code\n",
        "- **Fitness Calculation**: The fitness of a code is determined by counting how many characters in the code match the target code at the same positions\n",
        "- **Stopping Criteria**: The algorithm runs for a maximum of 100 generations, or until a code matches the target code exactly (fitness score of 10)\n",
        "- **Reproducibility**: While the genetic algorithm is random, for the purposes of our experiment, we are fixing a seed value so that the results are consistent for the purposes of evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Input Format**\n",
        "- **`target_code`**: A string of length 10, which is the target code that the population tries to evolve towards; the string consists of lowercase English letters (`'a'` to `'z'`)\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Output Format**\n",
        "- A dictionary containing:\n",
        "  - **`generations`**: The number of generations it took to reach the target code (or 100 if it didn't match)\n",
        "  - **`fitness_stats`**: A dictionary containing:\n",
        "    - **'mean'**: the mean of the fitness scores for each generation\n",
        "    - **'standard deviation'**: the standard deviation of the fitness scores for each generation\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Constraints**\n",
        "- The means and standard deviations are rounded to two decimal places\n",
